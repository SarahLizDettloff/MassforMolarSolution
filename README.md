# Calculator - Mass for Molarity
This application calculates the mass for a molar solution. <br />
It was made in Visual Studio 2017 and uses Visual Basic. <br />

# Purpose
This calculator allows you to discover the mass molarity of a compound which requires a concentration and volume. Scientists practice this equation in order to make solutions. <br />
Formula weight is the sum of the atomic weights of every atom in a given empirical formula. <br />
Molar concentration is the total amount of a solute present in one unit of a solution. Molar concentration is also known as molarity. <br />
The mass is important to know because it is the amount of matter present in a substance. Mass is different from weight, since it is not affected by gravity that makes the value constant.<br />
In order to calculate the mass required for a molar solution follow this equation: <br />
Mass (g) = Concentration (mol/L) * Volume (L) * Formular Weight (g/mol) <br />
