Formula weight is the sum of the atomic weights of every atom in a given empirical formula.
Molar concentration is the total amount of a solute present in one unit of a solution. Molar concentration is also known as molarity. 
The mass is important to know because it is the amount of matter present in a substance. Mass is different from weight, since it is not affected by gravity that makes the value constant.
In order to calculate the mass required for a molar solution follow this equation:
Mass (g) = Concentration (mol/L) * Volume (L) * Formular Weight (g/mol)
